## 1. Market Basket Analysis
  Market Basket Analysis is a process of finding the frequency of collections items in a large transaction database. This is done to determine the association and correlation between items.
  Apriori is one algorithm used for market basket analysis. Apriori is designed to operate on databases that contain transactions.    Terminology of a priori algorithm include:
  - Support: Indicator stating how often an item appears in a dataset
  - Confidence: Indicator stating how often a rule found is true.
  - Lift: The ratio value of the observed support value with the expectation if X and Y are free from each other.
Then implementation of apriori algorithm is done by using python to find the association of the items given.
